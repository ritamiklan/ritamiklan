<h4>Hi, I’m Rita!</h4>

I'm completing a BBA in Haaga-Helia UAS which I Started in January 2020 to take my interest in coding to the next level.

I'm currently focusing on front-end development using React and learning more about mobile app development as well.

My other passion is specialty coffee - I am also an aspiring home barista.
